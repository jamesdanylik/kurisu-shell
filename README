Implementation Notes

Project Log
===========

* The skeleton fails to build by default, due to strict warnings and unused
  parameters.  Readding void declarations in front of the unused the variables
  in order to avoid changing the build process, as I want the strict checks!
  Added voids to read-command.c and execute-command.c, and everything builds
  as expected.

* After a nasty incident involving a wayward 'git rm -rf', I'm back up and
  running.  Getting the git repo up first this time... doh!
